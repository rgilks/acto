### 1. Character Creation System

**A. Core Template**  
Use this concise bullet format for every character:

- **Name**
- **Concept**: One‑line summary (hero, rogue, mystic, etc.)
- **Race / Species**
- **Background & Motivation**: 1–2 lines
- **Appearance**: 3–5 vivid details
- **Traits (0–4 pairs)**: Always list _strength + matching flaw_ per pair (e.g. **Formidable** but **Aloof**)
- **Special Abilities / Skills (2–3)**: Prose descriptions of standout powers or proficiencies
- **Equipment (2–4)**: Function + 1‑line flavor
- **Story Hook**: Single quest seed or conflict note

**B. Trait Pairing**

- Pick between 0 and 4 pairs.
- Each pair balances a strong virtue (Formidable, Charismatic, Fleet‑footed) against a drawback (Aloof, Reckless, Distrustful).

**C. Abilities & Skills**

- Limit to 2–3 per character for brevity.
- Describe in-world effect in 1–2 sentences—no mechanics or numbers.
- Include any special proficiencies (weave them into the prose).

**D. Equipment**

- List 2–4 items.
- Start with **Function:** (what it does), then **Flavor:** (visual or sensory detail).

**E. Story Hooks**

- One or two hints at a personal quest, hidden relic, or rival.

### 2. AI Image‑Generation Prompt Guide

To reproduce the **retro‑pulp sci‑fi** style from mid‑20th‑century covers, use this structure:

```text
[Subject description], standing in [environment], [action or stance],
**style tags**: "retro pulp sci‑fi painting", "oil painting texture", "smooth brushwork", "dramatic cinematic lighting", "vintage paperback cover art", "bold composition",
**color palette**: "rich earth tones with glowing embers and cool metallic highlights"
```

**A. Subject Description**

- Identify role & attire (e.g. “exiled warrior in horned steel helm and layered tribal‑tech armor”).
- Mention key props (“wields a spear glowing with molten light”).

**B. Environment & Composition**

- Place them in a stark, exotic landscape: desert canyons, alien ruins, swirling skies, ringed planets in the distance.
- Use dynamic pose: heroic front‑and‑center, three‑quarter view.

**C. Art‑Style Keywords**

- _Retro pulp sci‑fi painting_
- _Painterly oil texture_ / _airbrushed brushstrokes_
- _Dramatic highlights & shadows_ / _cinematic lighting_
- _Vintage paperback cover_ / _1970s pulp illustration_
- _Subtle surreal/organic forms_ (twisting alien shapes)

**D. Color Palette**

- Base in **warm earth tones** (burnt sienna, ochre) + **cool highlights** (steel blue, deep teal).
- Use **glowing accents** (amber embers, faint neon cyan) sparingly to punctuate armor or energy effects.
- Avoid purely psychedelic neons; keep a grounded, slightly muted warmth.

**E. Optional Flourishes**

- Bubble helmets or energy shields rendered as softly glowing orbs.
- Background elements: distant moons, swirling mist, fractured monoliths.
- Add painterly artifacts: visible brush texture, slight canvas grain.

### 3. Example Prompt

```text
A lone sentinel in horned steel helm and ember‑veined leather‑alloy armor, holding a molten‑lit spear across rugged desert canyons at sunset, retro pulp sci‑fi painting, oil painting texture, dramatic cinematic lighting, vintage paperback cover art, bold composition, rich earth tones with glowing ember accents, distant ringed planet on the horizon
```

### 4. Tips for Iteration

- **Adjust lighting**: “golden hour glow” vs. “moody twilight shadows.”
- **Refine palette**: shift accent color (“ember orange” → “crimson ember”)
- **Tweak composition**: specify “three‑quarter view” or “low angle shot.”
- **Add texture notes**: “visible brushstrokes” or “slightly worn canvas effect.”
